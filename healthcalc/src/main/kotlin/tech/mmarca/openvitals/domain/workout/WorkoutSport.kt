 * The sports the watch records, with the facts both apps need about each:
 * the phone's entry form reads the same table, so a sport is described once.
 * Names and icons stay in the apps' string resources.
 *
 * [gps], [distance] and [elevation] are what the phone's form offers for the
 * sport. [steps] and [floors] are what the watch counts while it records.
 * The watch measures a distance only with GPS; the phone derives an indoor
 * one afterwards.
