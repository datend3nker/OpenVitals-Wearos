/**
 * RMSSD from beat times, after the intervals that cannot be a resting heart
 * are taken out.
 *
 * RMSSD is the root mean square of the differences between successive
 * normal-to-normal intervals. Its definition and the need to remove ectopic
 * beats before computing it are standard (Task Force of the ESC and NASPE,
 * "Heart rate variability: standards of measurement", Circulation 93(5),
 * 1996, doi:10.1161/01.CIR.93.5.1043). The field's usual normative tables
 * (e.g. Shaffer & Ginsberg, "An Overview of Heart Rate Variability Metrics
 * and Norms", Frontiers in Public Health 5:258, 2017,
 * doi:10.3389/fpubh.2017.00258) are for 24-hour or multi-minute recordings
 * with their own population; they say explicitly that short-window norms
 * are not interchangeable with those, so this file sets no "normal RMSSD"
 * range and none should be read off those tables for a 5-minute window.
 *
 * That a single artefact can bias RMSSD more than other HRV metrics is shown
 * empirically (e.g. Peltola, "Role of editing of R-R intervals in the
 * analysis of heart rate variability", Frontiers in Physiology, and the 2021
 * Journal of Sports Science and Medicine study on artefact sensitivity of
 * RMSSD and SDNN), but no single paper fixes the correction thresholds
 * below. There is no universally agreed artefact-rejection method (every
 * source above says so); the specific numbers here (a quarter of the local
 * median, a 30% successive step, five-beat neighbourhood, minimum beat
 * counts) are this app's own choice, built in the spirit of Kubios'
 * threshold correction but not copied from it, and not validated against an
 * ECG or chest-strap reference.
